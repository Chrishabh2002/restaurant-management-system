This project was bootstrapped with Create React App for the frontend and Java with Spring Boot for the backend.

Project Overview
We have completed the React frontend development and are now starting to work on the backend to create a complete full-stack application.

Frontend Development
The frontend was created using React with a responsive and interactive UI. You can run the frontend using:

Available Scripts
In the frontend project directory, you can run:

npm start – Runs the app in development mode at http://localhost:3000.
npm test – Launches the test runner.
npm run build – Builds the app for production.
Backend Development
We are now adding the backend using Java and Spring Boot. This will provide robust server-side logic, API endpoints, and database management.

Backend Setup
Dependencies: The following dependencies have been added to the pom.xml:

spring-boot-starter-web – For building RESTful APIs.
spring-boot-starter-data-jpa – For database interactions using JPA.
mysql-connector-java – For MySQL database connection (or use another database driver as needed).
spring-boot-starter-security – For implementing security features.
lombok – (Optional) Reduces boilerplate code.
Running the Backend:

Ensure Java 17 or a compatible version is installed.
Navigate to the backend directory.
Run the command:
bash
Copy code
mvn spring-boot:run
The server will start at http://localhost:8080 by default.
Connecting Frontend and Backend
To enable communication between the React frontend and the Java backend, configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in your Spring Boot application:

java
Copy code
@Configuration
public class WebConfig implements WebMvcConfigurer {
    @Override
    public void addCorsMappings(CorsRegistry registry) {
        registry.addMapping("/**").allowedOrigins("http://localhost:3000");
    }
}
This configuration allows the frontend to make API requests to the backend without CORS issues.

Next Steps
Implement API endpoints for handling various functionalities.
Connect the frontend components with the backend API.
Set up database tables and test data integration.
