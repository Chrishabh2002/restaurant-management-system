# üçΩÔ∏è Restaurant Management System

This project is a comprehensive **Restaurant Management System** that brings together a modern **React frontend** and a powerful **Java Spring Boot backend**. It is designed to streamline restaurant operations and improve user experience through an interactive UI and robust server-side functionalities.

## üöÄ Project Overview

We have completed the development of the **React frontend**, delivering a responsive and engaging user interface. Now, we are focusing on the **backend** to transform this project into a fully functional **full-stack application**.

## üñ•Ô∏è Frontend Development

The **frontend** is built using **React**, featuring a user-friendly design and interactive components.

### Available Scripts

In the frontend project directory, you can run:

- **`npm start`**: Runs the app in development mode.\\
  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
- **`npm test`**: Launches the test runner for running tests.
- **`npm run build`**: Builds the app for production, optimizing for better performance.

## üõ†Ô∏è Backend Development

We're developing the **backend** using **Java** and **Spring Boot** to provide a robust and scalable server-side framework.

### Backend Setup

To get started with the **backend**, ensure the following steps:

1. **Install Java 17** or a compatible version.
2. Navigate to the `backend` directory of the project.
3. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
The backend server will start at http://localhost:8080.
Key Dependencies
The pom.xml file includes these essential dependencies:

spring-boot-starter-web: To build RESTful APIs.
spring-boot-starter-data-jpa: For seamless database interactions.
mysql-connector-java: To connect to a MySQL database (or use another DB driver as needed).
spring-boot-starter-security: To integrate security features.
lombok: (Optional) Helps reduce boilerplate code and simplifies development.
CORS Configuration
To enable communication between the React frontend and Spring Boot backend, set up CORS:

java
Always show details

Copy code
@Configuration
public class WebConfig implements WebMvcConfigurer {
    @Override
    public void addCorsMappings(CorsRegistry registry) {
        registry.addMapping("/**").allowedOrigins("http://localhost:3000");
    }
}
This configuration allows API requests from the frontend without cross-origin restrictions.

üìà Next Steps
Develop API Endpoints: Create endpoints for handling reservations, order management, user authentication, and more.
Integrate Frontend with Backend: Connect the React components to backend services for dynamic content.
Database Setup: Set up database tables and populate them with sample data for testing. """
